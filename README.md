# Da-Wei Lin Bio-Data Science Repository

Welcome to the repository of my personal page - [Index page](https://tealeave.github.io/da-wei-lin-data/index.html)
## Overview

This repository showcases my research and expertise in the following areas:

- **Metabolomics & Cell Cycle**: Understanding the communication between metabolic pathways and the cell proliferation machinery.
  
- **Tumor Suppressor Gene Reactivation**: Developing novel approaches for directed drug design, especially in the development of small molecules to reactivate mutant p53 in human cancer.
  
- **Proteomics & CRISPR**: Mapping protein functions and complex interactions using CRISPR-directed gene editing and Mass-Spec analysis.
  
- **Next-Generation Characterization of Tumor Cells**: Leveraging NGS and Informatics for meta-analysis on the One-Carbon Cycle with Depmap.
